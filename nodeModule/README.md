Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package and Node Module as if they are the same, while there are similarities, how do they differ from one another?

        A NPM Package is defined and must have a package.json file. A node module is a file that can be loaded by a require() function. (modules do not requre a package.json file but having one will also make it a package.)

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community?

push to github as well as publishing to npm (npm publish)
